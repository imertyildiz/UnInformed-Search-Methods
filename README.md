# UnInformed Search Methods
 This code represents Uninformed searching methods, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-Limited Search (DLS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), Iterative-Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS), Depth-Limited Depth-First Search (DLDFS), Iterative-Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)) with the TREE-SEARCH algorithm at the implementation level.
